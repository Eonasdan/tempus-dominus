    In v6 I dropped moment as a required library since it is no longer recommended. Almost all the functions in the
    picker make use of my custom DateTime class which extends the native Date object.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because I am simply extending the native date object, any returned values will still behave like a date object.
    Which means you don't need to adopt using DateTime in your project unless you want to. Once less library to worry about!
